#### Based in Singapore.

I am a recently graduated from Imperial College London with an M.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering.  

For my thesis, I designed a novel neural architecture that integrated hard negative mining into Geoffery Hinton's [Forward-Forward Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13345) and evaluated this on Online Continual Learning tasks using the [River](https://riverml.xyz/latest/) benchmark.    

My research interests include Online Continual Learning, with the long-term goal developing scalable, lifelong learning systems.
