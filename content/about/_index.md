#### Based in London, UK.

Final Year MEng Electronic and Information Engineering @ Imperial College.   

Interested in the intersection of neural networks and control theory: (1) How can we apply Lyapunov stability theory to prove machine learning robustness, and (2) How can we utilise neuromorphic methods in adaptive control?
