#### Electronic and Information Engineering at Imperial. Based in London, UK.

My name is Clemen, and I am a student at Imperial College London.  

I started my journey into technology as a System Administrator Team Lead in the defence sector for a year, maintaining mission-critical workloads and testing mission readiness during large-scale exercises. I was also involved in cloud migration and cybersecurity buildup operations. I've worked part-time as a developer for Imperial's Computational Cardiac Research Lab, where I managed the containers and cloud side of the house as part of a team developing a full-stack framework for bioinformatics data processing. I've also advised several startups on cloud migration and the Imperial Education Office on sustainability analytics. I most recently also interned at Amazon Web Services where I worked in the 5G infrastructure space.      

The coolest thing I've built would definitely be our self-balancing maze solver for the 2nd year project.  

At school, I've completed a wide range of modules across electrical engineering and computer science. I have a wide variety of interests that span from programming languages, networks, data science, security, database systems, computer architecture to communications. I don't really have a niche and really enjoy seeing different fields meld together - something I encountered often in past projects. I believe in holistic education for technologists, though this is more of a self-driven effort at Imperial.     

I delievered a series of 4 lectures on Building Data Platforms at the Imperial College Data Science Society and enjoy teaching and training.  

I hold the following certifications: (1) AWS Security Specialty, and (2) AWS Solutions Architect Professional.
