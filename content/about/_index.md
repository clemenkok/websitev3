#### Associate DevOps Consultant Intern at Amazon Web Services. Imperial College London Electronic and Information Engineering. Based in London, UK.

My name is Clemen, and I am a student at Imperial College London. I am currently working at Amazon Web Services as a Associate DevOps Consultant Intern, where I am working in the 5G and Kubernetes space.   

I started my journey into technology as a System Administrator Team Lead in the defence sector for a year, maintaining mission-critical workloads and testing mission readiness during large-scale exercises. I was also involved in cloud migration and cybersecurity buildup operations. I've worked part-time as a developer for Imperial's Computational Cardiac Research Lab, where I managed the containers and cloud side of the house as part of a team developing a full-stack framework for bioinformatics data processing. I've also advised several startups on cloud migration.    

I've also started my journey into Open Source by participating in the [KubeArmor](https://kubearmor.io/) Project to work on improving DNS egress visibility using eBPF. KubeArmor is a well-established Zero Trust security platform for Kubernetes workloads in the cloud. Combined with an admission controller platform such as Kyverno, one can establish a robust, layered security approach to defending cloud assets from zero day attacks.   

At school, I've completed a wide range of modules across electrical engineering and computer science. My academic interest lies in researching the use of Deep Learning in enabling next-generation communication systems, which I endeavour to pursue as my thesis project. I hold the following AWS certifications: (1) AWS Security Specialty, and (2) AWS Solutions Architect Professional.
