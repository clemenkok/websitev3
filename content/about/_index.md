#### Associate DevOps Consultant Intern at Amazon Web Services. Imperial College London Electronic and Information Engineering. Based in London, UK.

My name is Clemen, and I am a student at Imperial College London. I am currently working at Amazon Web Services as a Associate DevOps Consultant Intern.   

I started my journey into technology as a System Administrator Team Lead in the defence sector for a year, maintaining mission-critical workloads and testing mission readiness during large-scale exercises. I was also involved in cloud migration and cybersecurity buildup operations. I've worked part-time as a developer for Imperial's Computational Cardiac Research Lab, where I managed the containers and cloud side of the house as part of a team developing a full-stack framework for bioinformatics data processing. I've also advised several startups on cloud migration.    

My interests mainly lie in Communication Systems, Cloud Computing and DevOps. At school, I've completed a wide range of modules across electrical engineering and computer science.
