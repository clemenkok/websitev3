### this

In C++, the "this" keyword is a pointer that refers to the current object instance. When a member function is called, the object that called it is passed as a hidden argument. The "this" keyword is used to access members of that object.

Here is an example:

```
csharpCopy code
class MyClass {
  public:
    void setX(int x) {
        this->x = x;
    }
  private:
    int x;
};

int main() {
  MyClass obj;
  obj.setX(5);
  return 0;
}

```

In the example above, the "setX" function takes an argument "x" and sets the member variable "x" of the current object to the value of the argument. The "this" keyword is used to refer to the current object instance and access its member variable "x".

### OOP vs FP

Object-oriented programming (OOP) and functional programming (FP) are two different paradigms in programming that approach the problem of writing software in different ways.

OOP is a programming paradigm that focuses on modeling the problem domain as a set of interacting objects that have attributes and behaviors. The objects communicate with each other by sending messages, and the behavior of the system is defined by the interactions between the objects. OOP languages such as Java, C++, and Python provide mechanisms for defining classes, objects, and inheritance.

On the other hand, FP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes on the use of mathematical functions to express computations. The focus is on writing functions that take inputs and produce outputs without changing the state of the program or the system. FP languages such as Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang provide mechanisms for defining functions, higher-order functions, and recursion.

Here are some of the key differences between OOP and FP:

1. Data and behavior: In OOP, data and behavior are bundled together into objects, while in FP, data and behavior are separated into functions.
2. Mutable vs. immutable: OOP allows mutable objects, where the state of an object can be changed during its lifetime. FP, on the other hand, emphasizes immutable data structures and avoids mutable state.
3. Inheritance vs. composition: OOP uses inheritance as a mechanism for code reuse, where new classes can be derived from existing ones. FP emphasizes composition, where functions are combined together to create more complex functions.
4. Side effects: OOP often involves side effects, where a method call can change the state of the program. FP avoids side effects and emphasizes pure functions, which have no side effects.

Both paradigms have their own strengths and weaknesses and are useful in different contexts. OOP is often used in large-scale systems with complex behavior, while FP is often used in systems that require high levels of concurrency and parallelism, or in systems where correctness and safety are critical.

### ANTLR4 Visitor

In the context of parsing with ANTLR4 and other parsing frameworks, a visitor is a design pattern used to traverse and operate on a parse tree generated by the parser. In C++, a visitor is typically implemented as a C++ class that provides a set of methods for visiting and processing each node of the parse tree.

When the parser generates a parse tree, it represents the input as a tree of nodes, with each node corresponding to a symbol or token in the input text. A visitor is then used to traverse this tree, visiting each node in turn and performing some operation or generating output based on the structure of the tree.

The visitor pattern provides a flexible way to define different operations on the parse tree, while keeping the core parsing logic separate from the processing logic. For example, you might define one visitor class to perform semantic analysis on the parse tree, another to generate code from the parse tree, and so on.

Here's an example of a visitor class in C++ for an ANTLR4-generated parse tree:

```
cppCopy code
class MyVisitor : public MyGrammarBaseVisitor {
public:
  virtual antlrcpp::Any visitMyRule(MyGrammarParser::MyRuleContext *ctx) override {
    // Visit the child nodes of the MyRuleContext
    visitChildren(ctx);

    // Perform some operation based on the parse tree structure
    // ...

    return antlrcpp::Any(); // Return a result if necessary
  }
};

```

In this example, **`MyVisitor`** is a subclass of **`MyGrammarBaseVisitor`**, which is a base class generated by ANTLR4 that provides default implementations for visiting each type of parse tree node. The **`visitMyRule`** method is overridden to perform some operation on a **`MyGrammarParser::MyRuleContext`** node, which is a node in the parse tree corresponding to a specific rule in the grammar.

When the visitor is used to traverse the parse tree, the **`visitMyRule`** method will be called for each **`MyRuleContext`** node in the tree, allowing you to perform some operation or generate output based on the structure of the tree.

### context

In C++, "context" generally refers to the state or environment in which a particular operation or computation is taking place. The context can include various factors such as the values of input parameters, the current state of program execution, and the state of any relevant data structures or objects.

For example, in the context of a function call, the context might include the values of the function's input parameters, the state of any relevant global variables, and the state of any relevant data structures or objects. In the context of a loop iteration, the context might include the current loop index, the state of any relevant data structures or objects, and the state of the program execution up to that point.

In the context of parsing with ANTLR4 or other parsing frameworks, "context" generally refers to a specific node in the parse tree that represents a specific syntactic construct in the input text. The context object typically provides access to information about the attributes or properties of the corresponding syntactic construct, such as its position in the input text, its type or category, and any associated semantic information. Visiting a context object allows you to perform some operation or generate output based on the attributes or properties of the corresponding syntactic construct.

### Static vs Dynamic Casting

In C++, both static_cast and dynamic_cast are used for type casting, but they differ in their behavior and usage.

Static_cast:

- It performs a compile-time cast, where the compiler checks whether the conversion is valid or not at compile-time.
- It can be used to convert between related types, such as converting from int to double, or from a base class pointer to a derived class pointer.
- It can also be used to perform arithmetic conversions, such as converting from an int to a float.
- It is a safer and faster way of casting compared to C-style casting, but it does not perform any runtime checks.

Dynamic_cast:

- It performs a runtime cast, where the compiler checks whether the conversion is valid or not at runtime.
- It is typically used for downcasting (converting from a base class pointer to a derived class pointer) or when working with polymorphic types.
- It returns a null pointer if the conversion is not possible or invalid.
- It has a higher runtime cost compared to static_cast due to the additional runtime checks.

### 3AC and IR

Intermediate representation (IR) and three-address code (3AC) are related concepts, but they are not the same.

Intermediate representation is a high-level, abstract representation of a program that serves as an intermediate step between the program's source code and its machine code. The IR is typically designed to be language-independent, meaning that it can represent the program's semantics without relying on the specifics of any particular programming language. The IR is used as an intermediate step to facilitate various analyses and optimizations that the compiler performs on the program.

Three-address code, on the other hand, is a specific form of IR that represents each operation in the program as a sequence of three operands. Each operand can be a variable name, a constant value, or a memory location, and the sequence represents the operation to be performed and the operands on which it operates. For example, an assignment statement in a program might be represented in 3AC as "t1 = x + y", where t1 is a temporary variable, and x and y are variables or constants.

Three-address code is a common form of IR used in many compilers because it is easy to generate and can be optimized and translated into machine code efficiently. However, not all intermediate representations use the three-address code form, and some IRs may use more or fewer operands per instruction.

In summary, three-address code is a specific form of intermediate representation that represents each operation in a program as a sequence of three operands, but intermediate representation encompasses a broader set of concepts and includes many different forms beyond just three-address code.

### first and second

I'm sure you know that a `std::vector<X>` stores a whole bunch of `X` objects, right? But if you have a `std::map<X, Y>`, what it actually stores is a whole bunch of `std::pair<const X, Y>`s. That's exactly what a map is - it pairs together the keys and the associated values.

When you iterate over a `std::map`, you're iterating over all of these `std::pair`s. When you dereference one of these iterators, you get a `std::pair` containing the key and its associated value.

```
std::map<std::string, int> m = /* fill it */;
auto it = m.begin();

```

Here, if you now do `*it`, you will get the the `std::pair` for the first element in the map.

Now the type `[std::pair](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/pair)` gives you access to its elements through two members: `first` and `second`. So if you have a `std::pair<X, Y>` called `p`, `p.first` is an `X` object and `p.second` is a `Y` object.

So now you know that dereferencing a `std::map` iterator gives you a `std::pair`, you can then access its elements with `first` and `second`. For example, `(*it).first` will give you the key and `(*it).second` will give you the value. These are equivalent to `it->first` and `it->second`.
