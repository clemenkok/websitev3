### IWTL = I Want To Learn

I think the only constant in technology is that we need to keep learning. There's so many subdisciplines, and you can just keep going deeper and deeper into one - and realise that if you want to progress further you need to try out another subdsicipline. Even the most astute data scientist needs to know a bit of DevOps and Cloud; the best Full-Stack Engineer eventually realises they need to know some machine learning.  

So here's my list that I will look at in a year (in order of 'things I know 0 about' to 'things I know something about'):

- Functional Programming with Scala / Erlang
- Probabilistic Graphical Models
- ROS
- Bayesian Statistics and Bayesian Learning
- Stochastic Processes (Markov Chains, Markov Decision Processes)
- Reinforcement Learning
- Distributed Systems (Multi-Paxos and RAFT)
- Mobile Development (React Native)
- Google Cloud Platform
- Concurrency in C++ (Only worked with RTOSes before)
